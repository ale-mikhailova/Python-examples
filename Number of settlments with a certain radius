'''Given is n localities, each of which in some relative coordinate system has two coordinates x and y. 
A radio station with a range of r km is installed at the point with the number (index) k. 
Determine how many localities fall within its radius (including locality k).

Input data:

- a list of the settlementscoordinates on the OX axis;
- a list of the settlementscoordinates on the OY axis;
- the number (index) of the locality k (an integer in the range from 0 to n-1);
- the range of the radio station r.

Output data:
- the number of settlements that are within the range of the radio station.'''
