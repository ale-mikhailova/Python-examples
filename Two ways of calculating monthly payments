'''Banks offer loans to the population with two ways of calculating monthly payments: 
annuity (when a person pays the same amount monthly throughout the entire loan period) and differentiated 
(in this case, the monthly loan repayment payment gradually decreases by the end of the loan period).
The loan amount is s rubles, the loan term is n months, the percentage is k%.

Calculate monthly payments for each month, as well as the bank's income for each method 
(the difference between the total payment and the loan amount).'''
